# Natural Language Processing Final Project
 

## Research Question

My final project compares the first Harry Potter book to the first movie (Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone). My overall research question is: are the characters speaking differently in the books versus the movies?

## Methods

I extracted all of the spoken text per main character and compared the quality of the text between the book and the movie. I used regular expressions to do this for the novel.

My overall analysis is through tf-idf (spoken words per character), word complexity, and sentence length.

## Datasets

the Harry Potter R Package on Github has each book text: https://github.com/bradleyboehmke/harrypotter/tree/master/data. I converted the rda of the first book file to a csv, which is not shown in this analysis since it was done with R Studio. For the movies, I found the first movie script here: https://www.kaggle.com/gulsahdemiryurek/harry-potter-dataset

## Findings

Look at the word doc (essay version) or pdf slides (presentation version) to see my findings.
