    "My final project compares the Harry Potter books versus the movies. I extracted all of the spoken text per main character and compared the quality of the text between the books to the movies. I first used regular expressions to do this. \n",

    "My overall research question is: are the characters speaking differently in the books versus the movies? Some examples of this will be through tf-idf (spoken words per character), word complexity, and sentence length.\n",

    "Dataset: the Harry Potter R Package on Github has each book text. I can convert the rda of each file to a csv. https://github.com/bradleyboehmke/harrypotter/tree/master/data. For the movies, the scripts are published here: https://www.kaggle.com/gulsahdemiryurek/harry-potter-dataset. I could also use the Harry Potter API for more information if needed: https://www.potterapi.com/"

Then, I reset the index, renamed the columns, and now I have my pre final version of the book 1 df. Then, I added a period to the end of every quote in the df, which will be helpful for later analysis (measuring complexity needs punctuation to work). Then, I drop some of the unnecessary columns. Now, I have my final version of the book 1 df."

Ah, Professor, I would trust Hagrid with my life. No problems, I trust, Hagrid? Albus, do you really think it's safe, leaving him with these people? The only family he has. Exactly. He's far better off growing up away from all of that. Until he's ready. There, there, Hagrid. It's not really goodbye, after all. Good luck...Harry Potter. I have a few start-of-term notices I wish to announce. The first years, please note that the Dark Forest is strictly forbidden to all students. Also, our caretaker, Mr. Filch, has asked me to remind you that the third-floor corridor on the right hand side is out of bounds to everyone who does not wish to die a most painful death. Thank you. Let the feast begin. SILLLLLEEENNNNCEEEEE! Everyone will please, not panic. Now, Prefects will lead their houses back to the dormitories. Teachers will follow me to the dungeons. Back again, Harry? I see that you, like so many before you, have discovered the delights of the Mirror of Erised. I trust by now you realize what it does. Let me give you a clue. The happiest man on earth would look into the mirror and see only himself, exactly as he is. Yes...and no. It shows us nothing more or less than the deepest, most desperate desires of our hearts. Now you, who have never known your family, you see them standing beside you. But remember this, Harry. This mirror gives us neither knowledge or truth. Men have wasted away in front of it, even gone mad. That is why tomorrow it will be moved to a new home, and I must ask you not to go looking for it again. It does not do to dwell on dreams, Harry, and forget to live. Good afternoon, Harry. Ah. Tokens from your admirers? What happened down in the dungeons between you and Professor Quirrell is a complete secret, so, naturally, the whole school knows. Ah, I see your friend Ronald has saved you the trouble of opening your Chocolate Frogs. Fine. They're both just fine. Relax, dear boy. The stone has been destroyed. My friend Nicholas and I had a little chat and agreed it was best all around. He has enough Elixir to set his affairs in order. But yes, he will die. Ah. You see, only a person who wanted to find the Stone, find it, but not use it, would be able to get it. That is one of my more brilliant ideas. And between you and me thats saying something. Ah, I'm afraid there are ways in which he can return. Harry, do you know why Professor Quirrell couldn't bear to have you touch him? It was because of your mother. She sacrificed herself for you, and that kind of act leaves a mark. No, no, this kind of mark cannot be seen. It lives in your very skin. Love, Harry, love. Ah. Bertie Bott's Every Flavour Beans. I was most unfortunate in my youth to come across a vomit flavoured one, and since then I have lost my liking for them. But I think I could be safe with a nice toffee... Mm. Alas. Earwax. Another year gone. And now, as I understand it, the house cup needs awarding, and the points stand thus. In fourth place, Gryffindor with 312 points. Third place, Hufflepuff, with 352 points. In second place, Ravenclaw, with 426 points And in first place, with 472 points, Slytherin House. Yes, yes, well done Slytherin, well done Slytherin. However, recent events must be taken into account. And I have a few last minute points to award. To Miss Hermione Granger, for the use of cool intellect when others were in great peril, 50 points. Second, to Mr. Ronald Weasley, for the best played game of chess that Hogwarts has seen these many years...50 points. And third, to Mr. Harry Potter, for pure nerve and outstanding courage, I award Gryffindor house 60 points. And finally, it takes a great deal of bravery to stand up to your enemies, but a great deal more to stand up to your friends. I award 10 points to Neville Longbottom. Assuming that my calculations are correct, I believe that a change of direction is in order. Gryffindor wins the House Cup! \"],\n",
       " 'Hagrid': ['Professor Dumbledore, sir. Professor McGonagall. No, sir. Little tyke fell asleep just as we were flying over Bristol. Try not to wake him. There you go. Sorry about that. Dry up, Dursley, you great prune. Mind, I haven\\'t seen you since you was a baby, Harry. But you\\'re a bit more along than I would have expected. Particularly \\'round the middle. Well, of course you are. Got something for you. Afraid I might have sat on it at somepoint, but I imagine it\\'ll taste fine just the same. Baked it myself, words and all. It\\'s not every day that your young man turns 11, now is it? Rubeus Hagrid, Keeper of Keys and Grounds at Hogwarts. Of course, you know all about Hogwarts. No? Blimey, Harry, didn\\'t you ever wonder where your mum and dad learned it all? You\\'re a wizard, Harry. A wizard. And a thumping good one, I\\'d wager, once you\\'re trained up little. Well, Just Harry, did you ever make anything happen? Anything you couldn\\'t explain, when you were angry or scared? A car crash? A car crash killed Lily and James Potter? It\\'s an outrage! It\\'s a scandal! Oh, and I suppose a great Muggle like yourself\\'s going to stop him, are you? Non-magic folk. This boy\\'s had his name down ever since he were born. He\\'s going to the finest school of witchcraft and wizardry in the world and... he\\'ll be under the finest headmaster that Hogwarts has ever seen, Albus Dumbledore. Never insult Albus Dumbledore in front of me. Oh, um, I\\'d appreciate it if you didn\\'t tell anyone at Hogwarts about that. Strickly speaking, I\\'m not allowed to do magic. Ooh, We\\'re a bit behind schedule. Best be off. Unless you\\'d rather stay, of course. Essential bit of equipment, Harry. They don\\'t mean a penguin, do they? Crikey. I\\'d love a dragon. Vastly misunderstood beasts, Harry. Vastly misunderstood. If you know where to go. No, thanks, Tom. I\\'m on official Hogwarts business. Just helping young Harry here buy his school supplies. Hello, professor. I didn\\'t see you there. Harry, This is Professor Quirrell. He will be your Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher at Hogwarts Yes, well, must be going now. Lots to buy. See, Harry? You\\'re famous. I\\'m not sure I\\'m exactly the right person to tell you that, Harry. Welcome, Harry, to Diagon Alley. Here\\'s where you\\'ll get your quills and your ink. And over there, all your bits and bobs for doing your wizardry. Well there\\'s your money, Harry. Gringotts, the wizard bank. Ain\\'t no safer place, not one. Except perhaps Hogwarts. They\\'re goblins, Harry. Clever as they come goblins but not the most friendly of beasts. Best stay close. Mr. Harry Potter wishes to make a withdrawal. Oh, Wait a minute. Got it here somewhere. Ha! Here\\'s the little devil. Oh, and there\\'s something else as well. Professor Dumbledore gave me this. It\\'s about You-Know-What in vault you-know-which. Didn\\'t think your mum and dad will leave you with nothing, now did ya? Can\\'t tell you, Harry. Hogwarts business. Very secret. Best not to mention this to anyone, Harry. A wand? Well, you\\'ll want Ollivanders. There ain\\'t no place better. Why don\\'t you run along there and wait. I just got one more thing I gotta do. Won\\'t be long. Harry! Harry! Happy birthday. You all right, Harry? You seem very quiet. First, and understand this Harry because it\\'s very important: Not all wizards are good. Some of them go bad. A few years ago there was a one wizard who went as bad as he can go. His name was V... His name was V... No, I can\\'t spell it. All right, Voldemort. It was dark times, Harry. Dark times. Voldemort started to gather some followers. Brought them over to the Dark Side. Anyone that stood up to him ended up dead. Your parents fought against him. But nobody lived once he decided to kill them. Nobody, not one. Except you. Yes. That ain\\'t no ordinary cut on your forehead, Harry. A mark like that only comes from being touched by a curse, and an evil curse at that. Well, some say he died. Codswallop, in my opinion. Nope, I reckon he\\'s out there still too tired to carry on. But one thing\\'s absolutely certain. Something about you stumped him that night. That\\'s why you\\'re famous. That\\'s why everybody knows your name. You\\'re the boy who lived. What are you looking at? Blimey, is that the time? Sorry, Harry, I\\'m gonna have to leave you. Dumbledore will be wanting his... Well, he\\'ll be wanting to see me. Now, uh, your train leaves in 10 minutes. Here\\'s your ticket. Stick to it, Harry that\\'s very important. Stick to your ticket. Right, then. First years, this way, please! Come on, now, first years, don\\'t be shy. Come on now, hurry up. Hello, Harry. Right, then. This way to the boats. Come on, now, follow me. Well done! What\\'s going on with Harry\\'s broomstick? Go go go! Looks like he\\'s gonna be sick. Yes! Nonsense. Why would Snape put a curse on Harry\\'s broom? Who told you \\'bout Fluffy? Well, of course he\\'s got a name. He\\'s mine. I bought him off an Irish feller I met down at the pub last year. Then I lent him to Dumbledore to guard the Shouldn\\'ta said that.  No more questions! Don\\'t ask any more questions. That\\'s top secret, that is. Codswallop. Professor Snape is a Hogwarts teacher. Now, you listen to me, all three of you. You\\'re meddlin\\' in things that ought not to be meddled in. It\\'s dangerous. What that dog is guarding is strictly between Professor Dumbledore and Nicholas Flamel. I shouldn\\'t have said that. I should not have said that. I should not have said that. Oh, hello. Sorry, don\\'t wish to be rude, but I\\'m in no fit state to entertain today. Oh. Snape? Blimey, Harry, you\\'re not still on about him, are you? Snape is one of the teachers protecting the Stone! He\\'s not about to steal it! You heard. Right. Come on, now, I\\'m a bit preoccupied today. That\\'s right. Waste of bloody time, if you ask me. Ain\\'t no one gonna get past Fluffy. Hehe, not a soul knows how. Except for me and Dumbledore. I shouldn\\'t have told you that. I shouldn\\'t have told you that. Oh! Ooh! Ooh! Ooh! Ooh! That? It\\'s a ... its um... I won it. Off a stranger I met down at a pub. Seemed quite glad to be rid off it, as a matter of fact. Isn\\'t he beautiful? Oh. Bless him, look. He knows his mummy. Hehe. Hallo, Norbert. Yeah, well, he\\'s got to have a name, doesn\\'t he? Don\\'t you, Norbert? Dededede. Ohh! Oooh, ooh, ooh, well... He\\'ll have to be trained up a bit, of course. Who\\'s that? Oh, dear. Norbert\\'s gone. Dumbledore sent him off to Romania to live in a colony. Yeah, but what if he don\\'t like Romania? What if the other dragons are mean to him? He\\'s only a baby, after all. Right. Let\\'s go. What we\\'re here for. See that? That\\'s unicorn\\'s blood, that is. I found one dead a few weeks ago. Now, this one\\'s been injured bad by something. So, it\\'s our job to find the poor beast. Ron, Hermione, you\\'ll come with me. And Harry you\\'ll go with Malfoy. Fine. Just so you know, he\\'s a bloody coward. } Hello there, Firenze. I see you\\'ve met our young Mr. Potter. You all right there, Harry? I don\\'t know. I never saw his face. He kept his hood up. Well, he wanted to know what sort of creatures I looked after. I told him. I said, \"After Fluffy, a dragon\\'s gonna be no problem.\" Well, of course he was interested in Fluffy! How often do you come across a three headed dog, even if you\\'re in the trade? But I told him. I said, \"The trick with any beast is to know how to calm him. Take Fluffy, for example, just play him a bit of music and he falls straight to sleep.\" I shouldn\\'t have told you that. Where you going?! Wait! Yes! Come on now, hurry up. You\\'ll be late. Train\\'s leaving. Go on. Go on. Come on. Hurry up. Thought you were leaving without saying good-bye, didja? This is for you. Oh. Go on...on with you. Oh, listen, Harry, if that dolt of a cousin of yours, Dudley, gives you any grief, you could always, um, threaten him with a nice pair of ears to go with that tail of his. I do. But your cousin don\\'t, do he? Eh? Off you go. '],\n",
       " 'Harry': ['Yes, Aunt Petunia. Yes, Uncle Vernon. He\\'s asleep! Sorry about him. He doesn\\'t understand what it\\'s like, lying there day after day... ...watching people press their ugly faces in on you. Can you hear me? It\\'s just, I\\'ve never talked to a snake before. Do you...? I mean, do you talk to people often? You\\'re from Burma, aren\\'t you? Was it nice there? Do you miss your family? I see. That\\'s me as well. I never knew my parents either. Mummy, Dad, come here! Anytime. I swear, I don\\'t know! One minute the glass was there and then it was gone, it was like magic. Will I have to wear that too? That\\'s Dudley\\'s old uniform. It\\'ll fit me like bits of old elephant skin. Hey, give it back! It\\'s mine! Because there\\'s no post on Sundays? Get off! They\\'re my letters! Let go of me! Make a wish, Harry. I am. Thank you. Excuse me, who are you? Sorry, no. Learnt what? I\\'m a what? No, you\\'ve made a mistake. I mean...l can\\'t be a wizard. I mean, I\\'m just Harry. Just Harry. Dear Mr. Potter, We are pleased to inform you that you have been accepted at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry.\" You knew? You knew all along and you never told me? Blown up? You told me my parents died in a car crash. Muggle? Okay. First year\\'s students will require three sets of plain work robes one wand. One pair of dragon hide gloves. Hagrid, Do they mean from a real dragon? You\\'d like a dragon? All students must be equipped with one standard size 2 pewter cauldron and may bring, if they desire,\\r either an owl, a cat or a toad. Can we find all this in London? Oh, nice to meet you. Goodbye. But why am I famous, Hagrid? All those people back there, how is it they know who I am? But, Hagrid, how am I to pay for all this? I haven\\'t any money. Hagrid, what exactly are these things? What\\'s in there, Hagrid? I still need... a wand. Hello? Hello? Sorry, but what\\'s curious? And who owned that wand? He killed my parents, didn\\'t he? The one who gave me this. You know, Hagrid. I know you do. Maybe if you wrote it down? Voldemort? Me? Voldemort tried to kill me? What happened to V...? To You-Know-Who? Platform 9 3/4? But, Hagrid, there must be a mistake. This says platform 9 3/4. There\\'s no such thing, is there? Excuse me. Excuse me. Excuse me Sir, Can you tell me where I might find platform 9 3/4? Muggles? Excuse me. Could you tell me how to...? No. Not at all. I\\'m Harry. Harry Potter. The what? We\\'ll take the lot. Bertie Bott\\'s Every Flavor Beans? These aren\\'t real frogs, are they? I\\'ve got Dumbledore! Hey, he\\'s gone! Just a little bit. Yeah. Hey, Hagrid. I think I can tell the wrong sort for myself, thanks. Nothing. Nothing, I\\'m fine. Not Slytherin, not Slytherin! Say, Percy, who\\'s that teacher talking to Professor Quirrell? What\\'s he teach? I think she fancies you. We got lost. I don\\'t know, Sir. I don\\'t know, Sir. Clearly, Hermione knows. Seems a pity not to ask her. What\\'s Seamus trying to do to that glass of water? Can I borrow this? Thanks. Hey Ron! Somebody broke into Gringotts. Listen. Believed to be the work of Dark wizards or witches unknown Gringotts goblins while acknowledging the breach, insist nothing was taken. The vault in question, number 713, had, in fact, been emptied earlier that very same day.\" That\\'s odd. That\\'s the vault Hagrid and I went to. Give it here, Malfoy. Give it here or I\\'ll knock you off your broom! A century, according to McGonagall. But I\\'ve never even played Quidditch. What if I make a fool of myself? I-I didn\\'t know. Who doesn\\'t? What\\'s happening? Let\\'s go this way. Let\\'s go. Run! Quick, let\\'s hide through that door! It\\'s locked! And for good reason. Guarding something? I think so. What are those? What was that? I like this ball. What do I do with it? Whoa. I think we\\'re going to need another feather over here, Professor. I think she heard you. Where\\'s Hermione? How could a troll get in? Hermione! She doesn\\'t know! It\\'s going into the Girl\\'s Bathroom! Hermione, move! Whooa! Whoa, whoa! Do something! Anything! Hurry up! I don\\'t think so. Just knocked out. Ew. Troll bogies. Good of you to get us out of trouble like that. Mind you, she might not have needed saving if you hadn\\'t insulted her. I\\'m not hungry. That explains the blood. Listen, last night, I\\'m guessing Snape let the troll in as a diversion so he could try and get past that 3 headed dog. But, he got himself bitten, that\\'s why he\\'s limping. The day I was at Gringotts, Hagrid took something out of one of the vaults. He said it was Hogwarts\\' business, very secret. That\\'s what the dog\\'s guarding. That\\'s what Snape wants. But I-I never get mail. It\\'s a broomstick! But who...? A little. What happened? Yes! Whoa! Yes! Whoa! Whooa! Who knows. Why was he trying to get past that 3 headed dog on Halloween? Yes? But Hagrid, whatever Fluffy\\'s guarding, Snape\\'s trying to steal it! Exactly. Nicholas Flamel? Nicholas Flamel...Who\\'s Nicholas Flamel? Knight to E-5. Happy Christmas, Ron. What are you wearing? I\\'ve got presents? Oh! Your father left this in my possession before he died. It is time it was returned to you. Use it well. Some kind of...cloak. My body\\'s gone! I\\'m invisible?? There was no name. It just said, \"Use it well.\" Famous fire eaters... 15th Century Fiends...Flamel... Nicholas Flamel...where are you? Mum? Dad? Ron! You\\'ve really got to see this! Ron! You\\'ve got to see this! Ron, Ron, come on. Get out of bed! There\\'s something you\\'ve got to see. Now, come on! Come on. Come. Come look, it\\'s my parents! Look in properly. Go on. Stand there. There. You see them, don\\'t you? Thats my dad How can it? Both my parents are dead. No. No. So, then it shows us what we want? Whatever we want? Malfoy. I found him! Go on! I knew the name sound familiar. I read it on the train that day. Shh! Hagrid! We think Snape\\'s trying to steal it. Hagrid, we know he\\'s after the Stone. We just don\\'t know why. What? Wait a minute. One of the teachers? Uh, Hagrid, what exactly is that? Norbert? Malfoy. Hagrid always wanted a dragon. He told me so the first time I met him. I don\\'t understand. 50?! Hagrid, what\\'s that? If I didn\\'t know better, Draco, I\\'d say you were scared. What is it, Fang? But what was that thing you saved me from? But who would choose such a life? Do you mean to say...that that thing that killed the unicorn... that was drinking its blood...that was Voldemort? The Sorcerer\\'s Stone. But he\\'s weak. He\\'s living off the unicorns. Don\\'t you see? We had it wrong. Snape doesn\\'t want the stone for himself, he wants the stone for Voldemort. With the Elixir of Life, Voldemort will be strong again. He\\'ll He\\'ll come back. I think if he\\'d had the chance, he might have tried to kill me tonight. My scar. It keeps burning. Not like this. I think it\\'s a warning. It means dangers coming. Uhh! Oh. Of course! Don\\'t you think it\\'s a bit odd that what Hagrid wants more than anything is a dragon, and a stranger shows up and just happens to have one? I mean, how many people wander around with dragon eggs in their pockets? Why didn\\'t I see it before? Hagrid, who gave you the dragon egg? What did he look like? The stranger, though, you and he must have talked. And did he seem interested in Fluffy? We have to see Professor Dumbledore, immediately! He\\'s gone?! Now? But this is important! It\\'s about...the Sorcerer\\'s Stone. Someone\\'s going to try and steal it. That was no stranger Hagrid met in the village. It was Snape, which means he knows how to get past Fluffy. We go down the trapdoor. Tonight. Trevor. Now, Neville, listen. We were Let\\'s go. Sorry. Snoring Snape\\'s already been here. He\\'s put a spell on the harp. We have to move its paw. Come on! Okay. Push! I\\'ll go first. Don\\'t follow until I give you a sign. If something bad happens, get yourselves out… Does it seem a bit...quiet to you? Jump! Go! Whoa! Oh. Ahh! Hermione! Where are you?! Yeah, yeah, I\\'m fine. Apparently not. What? Ron, are you okay? Okay. Lucky Hermione pays attention in Herbology. I don\\'t know. Sounds like wings. They\\'re not birds, they\\'re keys. And I\\'ll bet one of them fits that door. I don\\'t know. Strange. There! I see it! The one with the broken wing! It\\'s too simple. Catch the key! Where are we? A graveyard. There\\'s the door. Wait a minute. No, Ron! No! He\\'s going to sacrifice himself! RON! NO! Don\\'t move! Dont forget, we\\'re still playing. Checkmate. Take care of Ron. Then, go to the owlery. Send a message to Dumbledore. Ron\\'s right...I have to go on. Not as good as you. You? No. It can\\'t be...Snape. He was the one B-but, that day, during the Quidditch Match, Snape tried to kill me. Snape was trying to...save me? Th-then you let the troll in. I-I\\'m shaking hands with Dumbledore. I\\'ve won the house cup. Voldemort. Never! You liar! Ahhhhhhhhh! Admirers? Ron was here? Is he all right? What about Hermione? But, what happened to the Stone? But Flamel, he\\'ll die, won\\'t he? How is it I got the Stone, sir? One minute I was staring in the mirror, and the next... Does that mean, with the Stone gone, I mean, that Voldemort can never come back? What is it? All right there, Ron? All right. Hermione? Good job. One minute. Thanks, Hagrid. But Hagrid, we\\'re not allowed to do magic away from Hogwarts. You know that. I\\'m not going home. Not really. '],\n",
       " 'Hermione': [\"Has anyone seen a toad? A boy named Neville's lost one Oh, are you doing magic? Let's see, then. Are you sure that's a real spell? Well, it's not very good, is it? Of course, I've only tried a few simple ones myself but they've all worked for me. For example: Oculus Reparo. That's better, isn't it? Holy cricket, you're Harry Potter! I'm Hermione Granger. And you are...? Pleasure. You two better change into robes. I expect we'll be arriving soon. You've got dirt on your nose, by the way. Did you know? Just there. It's not real, the ceiling. It's just bewitched to look like the night sky. I read about it in Hogwarts: A History. Oh, no. Okay, relax. Nearly headless? How can you be nearly headless? I've read about those. When the smoke turns red, it means you've forgotten something. Up. Up. Up! Harry, no way! You heard what Madam Hooch said. Besides, you don't even know how to fly. What an idiot. You won't make a fool of yourself. It's in your blood. The staircases change, remember? We're not supposed to be here. This is the 3rd floor. It's forbidden. Oh, move over! Alohomora Get in Standard book of spells, Chapter 7. Filch is gone. It was locked. You don't use your eyes, do you? Didn't you see what it was standing on? It was standing on a trap door. Which means it wasn't there by accident. It's guarding something. That's right. Now, if you two don't mind, I'm going to bed before either of you come up with another clever idea to get us killed...or worse, expelled! Stop, stop, stop. You're going to take someone's eye out. Besides, youre saying it wrong. It's Leviosa, not Leviosar. Wingardium Leviosa. Help! Help! Ahhh! Help! Swish and flick! Is it...dead? It's my fault, Professor McGonagall. I went looking for the troll. I'd read about them and thought I could handle it. But I was wrong. If Harry and Ron hadn't come and found me... I'd probably be dead. Ron's right, Harry. You're gonna need your strength today. Blood? But why would anyone go near that dog? So you're saying... Bit early for mail, isn't it? It's Snape! He's jinxing the broom! Leave it to me. Lacarnum Inflamarae. Whoo-hoo! That thing has a name? Hogwarts teacher or not, I know a curse when I see one. I've read all about them. You have to keep eye contact. And Snape wasn't blinking. I don't know. That's totally barbaric! See you haven't. Good. You can help Harry, then. He's going to go the library for information on Nicholas Flamel. Not in the restricted section... Happy Christmas. Look at you, playing with your cards. Pathetic! We've got final exams coming up soon. Alright, what are the 3 most crucial ingredients in a Forgetfulness Potion? And what, may I ask, do you plan to do if this comes up in the final exam? No, you won't. Besides, according to Professor McGonagall, we're to be given special quills bewitched with an Anti Cheating Spell. Follow me! I had you looking in the wrong section! How could I be so stupid? I checked this out a few weeks ago for a bit of light reading. Of course! Here it is! Nicholas Flamel is the only known maker of the Philosopher's Stone! Honestly, don't you two read? The Philosopher's Stone is a legendary substance with astonishing powers. It will turn any metal into pure gold and produces the Elixir of Life, which will make the drinker immortal. It means you'll never die. The only stone currently in existence belongs to Mr. Nicholas Flamel, the noted alchemist, who last year celebrated his 665th birthday! That's what Fluffy's guarding on the 3rd floor. That's what's under the trapdoor... the Philosopher's Stone! Of course! There are other things defending the Stone, aren't there? Spells and enchantments. Is that...a dragon? Is that bad? Well, that's good, isn't it? He'll be with his own kind. Harry! You mean, You-Know-Who's out there, right now, in the forest? Hang on a minute. We're forgetting one thing. Who's the one wizard Voldemort always feared? Dumbledore! As long as Dumbledore's around, you're safe. As long as Dumbledore's around, you can't be touched. I've always heard Hogwarts' end of the year exams were frightful, but I found that rather enjoyable. It's happened before. What is it? And with Dumbledore gone Uh...we were just... Now what do we do? Neville, I'm really, really sorry about this Petrificus Totalus. Sorry. Ow! You stood on my foot! Alohomora. The harp. It stopped playing. Stop moving, both of you. This is Devil's Snare. You have to relax. If you don't, it will only kill you faster. Just relax! Do what I say. Trust me. Are you okay? He's not relaxing, is he? We've got to do something! Uh! I remember reading something in Herbology. Um Devil's Snare, Devil's Scare,it's deadly fun...but will sulk in the sun! That's it! Devil's Snare hates sunlight! Lumus Solem! What is that? Curious. I've never seen birds like these. What's this all about? Ugh! What're we going to do? There must be 1000 keys up there! What's wrong, Harry? I don't like this. I don't like this at all. Now what do we do? What happens now? Ron, you don't suppose this is going to be like...real wizard's chess, do you? What is it? No, Ron, you can't! There must be another way! You'll be okay, Harry. You're a great wizard, you really are. Me? Books and cleverness? There are more important things. Friendship, and bravery. And Harry, just be careful. Never better. We're tied with Slytherin! Come on, Harry. Feels strange to be going home, doesn't it? \"],\n",

Welcome to Hogwarts. Now, in a few moments, you'll pass through these doors and join your classmates. But before you can take your seats, you must be sorted into your houses. They are Gryffindor, Hufflepuff Ravenclaw and Slytherin. Now, while you're here, your house will be like your family. Your triumphs will earn you points. Any rule-breaking, and you will lose points. At the end of the year, the house with the most points is awarded the house cup The Sorting Ceremony will begin momentarily. We're ready for you now. Follow me. All right, will you wait along here, please? Now, before we begin Professor Dumbledore would like to say a few words. When I call your name, you will come forth. I shall place the Sorting Hat on your head and you will be sorted into your houses. Hermione Granger. Draco Malfoy. Susan Bones. Ronald Weasley. Harry Potter. Your attention, please. Thank you for that assessment, Mr Weasley. Perhaps, lt'd be more useful if I were to transfigure Mr. Potter and yourself into a pocket-watch. That way, one of you might be on time. Then perhaps a map? I trust you don't need one to find your seats. Harry Potter! Follow me. You wait here. Professor Quirrell, excuse me. Could I borrow Wood for a moment please? Potter, this is Oliver Wood. Wood, I have found you a Seeker. Oh! Oh, my goodness! E-Explain yourselves, both of you! Ms. Granger? Be that as it may...it was an extremely foolish thing to do. I would have expected more rational behaviour on your part and I am very disappointed in you Ms. Granger. 5 points will be taken from Gryffindor for your serious lack of judgment. As for you two gentlemen I just hope you realize how fortunate you are. Not many first year students could take on a full grown mountain troll and live to tell the tale. 5 points...will be awarded to each of you. For sheer dumb luck. Good evening. Nothing, I repeat, nothing gives a student the right to walk about the school at night. Therefore, as punishment for your actions, 50 points will be taken. Each. And to ensure it doesn't happen again, all four of you will receive detention. No, you heard me correctly, Mr. Malfoy. You see, as honorable as your intentions were, you too were out of bed after hours. You will join your classmates in detention. I'm afraid Professor Dumbledore is not here. He received an urgent owl from the Ministry of Magic and left immediately for London. How do you know? I don't know how you three found out about the stone, but I can assure you it is perfectly well-protected. Now would you go back to your dormitories? Quietly. \"],\n",
       " 'Petunia': ['Up. Get up! Now! Here he comes, the birthday boy. Why don\\'t you just cook the breakfast, and try not to burn anything. I want everything to be perfect for my Dudley\\'s special day! Aren\\'t they wonderful, darling? Oh, now, now, now. This is what we\\'re going to do... is that when we go out, we\\'re going to buy you two new presents. How\\'s that, pumpkin? It should be a lovely day at the zoo. I\\'m really looking forward to it. My darling boy! How did you get in there? Who did this? How did you get in there? ls there a snake? It\\'s all right, sweetheart. We\\'ll get you out of these cold clothes. And smile! Vernon, just look at him! I can\\'t believe it! In just a week, he\\'ll be off to Smeltings. What? You? Go to Smeltings? Don\\'t be so stupid! You\\'re going to go to the state school. Where you belong. This is what you\\'ll going to be wearing, when I finish dyeing it. It\\'ll fit you well enough. Go get the post. Go! Have a lovely day at the office, dear. Of course we knew. How could you not be? My perfect sister being who she was. My mother and father were so proud the day she got her letter. We have a witch in the family. Isn\\'t it wonderful?\" I was the only one to see her for what she was. A freak! Then she met that Potter, and then she had you... and I knew you would be the same. Just as strange, just as abnormal. And then, if you please, she went and got herself blown up! And we got landed with you. We had to say something. '],\n",
       " 'Ron': [\"Excuse me. Do you mind? Everywhere else is full. I'm Ron, by the way. Ron Weasley. So it's true! I mean, do you really have the...? The scar? Wicked! No, thanks. I'm all set. They mean every flavor. There's chocolate and peppermint and there's also spinach, liver and tripe. George sweared he got a bogey-flavoured one once! It's just a spell. Besides, It's the cards you want. Each pack's got a famous witch or wizard. I've got about 500 myself. Watch it! Oh, that's rotten luck. They've only got one good jump in them to begin with. I got about six of him. Well, you can't expect him to hang around all day, can you? This is Scabbers, by the way. Pathetic, isn't he? Fred gave me a spell as to turn him yellow. Want to see? No. Sunshine, daisies, butter mellow. Turn this stupid fat rat yellow. I'm Ron Weasley. Wicked. Mental, that one, I'm telling you. There isn't a witch or wizard who went bad who wasn't in Slytherin. Harry, what is it? I know you. You're Nearly Headless Nick. Look at that one. Made it! Can you imagine the look on old McGonagall's face if we were late? That was bloody brilliant! Turn it into rum. Actually managed a weak tea yesterday, before... Mail's here. Up. Up! Shut up, Harry. Seeker? But first years never make their house teams! You must be the youngest Quidditch player in Fred and George are on the team, too. Beaters. Oh, go on, Harry, Quidditch is great. Best game there is! And you'll be great, too! Whoa. Harry, you never told me your father was a Seeker, too. I'm telling you, it's spooky. She knows more about you than you do. Ahh! Before the staircase moves again. Does anybody feel like...we shouldn't be here? It's Filch's cat! That's it, we're done for! Alohomora? Probably thinks this door's locked. What do they think they're doing?? Keeping a thing like that locked up in a school. I wasn't looking at its feet! I was a bit preoccupied with its heads. Or maybe you didn't notice, there were three! She needs to sort out her priorities! Wingardrium Leviosar. You do it then if you're so clever. Go on, go on. It's Leviosa, not Leviosar. Honestly, she's a nightmare. No wonder she hasn't got any friends! Not by itself. Trolls are really stupid. Probably people playing jokes. What? I think the troll's left the dungeon. Hey, pea brain! What? Wingardium Leviosa! Cool! Mind you, we did save her life. What are friends for? Take a bit of toast, mate. Go on. Let's open it. Thats not just a broomstick, Harry. It's a Nimbus 2000! Jinxing the broom? What do we do? Come on, Hermione! Go! Fluffy? Queen to E-5. That's wizard's chess. I see you've packed. Change of plans. My parents decided to go to Romania to visit my brother, Charlie. He's studying dragons there! We've looked a hundred times! I think we've had a bad influence on her. Harry, wake up! Come on Harry, wake up! Happy Christmas, Harry. Oh, Mum made it. Looks like you've got one too! Yeah! There they are. What is it? Well, let's see then. Put it on. Whoa! I know what that is! That's an invisibility cloak! They're really rare. I wonder who gave it to you. Why? I only see us. That's me! Only, I'm head boy...and I'm holding the Quidditch cup! And bloody hell, I'm Quidditch Captain too! I look good. Harry, do you think this mirror shows the future? I'll be right back. Wanna play chess? Wanna go and visit Hagrid? Harry, I know what you're thinking, but don't. There's something not right about that mirror. I'm ready. Ask me any question. I forgot. Copy off you. That's insulting! It's as if they don't trust us! Dumbledore again! Leg-Locker Curse? You have got to start standing up to people, Neville. Dumbledore is particularly famous for his defeat of the dark wizard Grindelwald in 1945. For the discovery of the twelve uses of dragon blood...and his work on alchemy with his partner, Nicholas Flamel! This is light? Immortal? I know what it means! I know what that is! But Hagrid, how did you get one? That's not just a dragon. That's a Norwegian Ridgeback! My brother Charlie works with these in Romania. It's crazy. And worse, Malfoy knows. It's bad. Okay. But if he comes back, you don't think he'll try to kill you, do you? And to think, I've been worrying about my Potions final! Speak for yourself. All right there, Harry? Perhaps you should see the nurse. Trevor shh! Go, you shouldn't be here! You're a little scary sometimes...you know that? Brilliant, but scary. It's for your own good, you know. Sorry. Wait a minute...he's.... Uh. It's got horrible breath! What?! Ew! Yuck! Ugh. Ahh! Whoa. Lucky this plant-thing is here, really. Kill us faster?! Oh, now I can relax! Now what are we gonna do?! Ahh! Harry! Harry! Help! Help! Help me! Help! Ahhh! Yeah. Whew. Lucky we didn't panic! Alohomora! Well, it was worth a try. We're looking for a big old fashioned one. Probably rusty like the handle. Oh, go on, Harry! If Snape can catch it on that old broomstick, you can! You're the youngest seeker in a century! This complicates things a bit! Hurry up! This is no graveyard. It's a chessboard. It's obvious, isn't it? We've got to play our way across the room. All right. Harry, you take the empty Bishop's square. Hermione, you'll be the Queen's side castle. As for me, I'll be a knight. Well, white moves first, and then...we play. You there! D-5! Yes, Hermione, I think this is going to be exactly like wizard's chess! Castle to E-4! Pawn to C-3! You understand right, Harry. Once I make my move, the Queen will take me...then you'll be free to check the King. Do you want to stop Snape from getting that Stone or not? Harry, it's you that has to go on. I know it. Not me, not Hermione, you. Knight...to H-3. Check. Ahhhh! All right? You? \"],\n",
       " 'Snape': [\"There will be no foolish wand-waving or silly incantations in this class. As such, I don't expect many of you to appreciate the subtle science and exact art that is potion-making. However, for those select few who possess the predisposition I can teach you how to bewitch the mind and ensnare the senses. I can tell you how to bottle fame brew glory and even put a stopper in death. Then again, maybe some of you have come to Hogwarts in possession of abilities so formidable that you feel confident enough to not pay attention. Mr. Potter. Our new celebrity. Tell me, what would I get if I added powdered root of asphodel to an infusion of wormwood? You don't know? Well, let's try again. Where, Mr Potter, would you look if I asked you to find me a bezoar? And what is the difference between monkshood and wolfsbane? Pity. Clearly, fame isn't everything is it, Mr. Potter? Silence. Put your hand down, you silly girl! For your information, Potter Asphodel and wormwood make a sleeping potion so powerful it is known as the Draught of the Living Dead. A bezoar is a stone taken from the stomach of a goat and it will save you from most poisons. As for monkshood and wolfsbane, they are the same plant, which also goes by the name of aconite. Well... Why aren't you all copying this down? And Gryffindors note that five points will be taken from your house for your classmate's cheek. Good luck today, Potter. Then again, now that you've proven yourself against a troll, a little game of Quidditch should be easy work for you...even if it is against Slytherin. What? Oh! You don't want me as your enemy, Quirrell. You know perfectly well what I mean. We'll have another chat soon... When you've had time to decide where your loyalties lie. Good afternoon. Now, what would three young Gryffindors such as yourselves be doing inside on a day like this? You want to be careful. People will think you're up to something. \"],\n",

Stop him! Don't be a fool! Why suffer a horrific death when you can join me and live?! Haha. Bravery. Your parents had it too. Tell me, Harry, would you like to see your mother and father again? Together, we can bring them back. All I ask for is something in return. That's it, Harry. There is no good and evil. There is only power, and those too weak to seek it.

Really break your leg. And no wonder we couldn't find Flamel in that Study of Recent Developments in Wizardry. It'll be gone by next Tuesday. Oh, we found out who he is ages ago. I'm going to see what section he was in. But it's against our laws. Of course there are. You're losing it, too. Maybe Snape's found out how to get past him without asking Hagrid. Yes, please. It's obvious. Yes, but not to us. You'll understand later, Neville. Don't be stupid. Looks like a harp. I think we'll be able to pull the door open. Right. Lucky this plant thing's here, really. Yeah. I think. I'm going to be a knight. White always plays first in chess. Had to let that happen. The whole school's talking about it. I always said he was off his rocker.

    "To calculate complexity, I first did a little data cleaning by dropping the average words per sentence column, since we no longer need that data. Then I used a textatistic library on each character listed below to calculate character count, word count, sentence count, syllable count, and other scores including the Flesch score (the lower the score, the more difficult the text is to read) and the Dalechall score (it measures a text against a number of words considered familiar to fourth-graders, and the more unfamiliar words used, the higher the reading level will be). I found that Dumbledore's sentences are the most complex, according to the Flesch score, and that Hermione's sentences are the most complex according to the Dalechall score."

    "Exactly the same as the movie, to calculate complexity, I first did a little data cleaning by dropping the average words per sentence column since we no longer need that data. Then I used a textatistic library on each character listed below to calculate character count, word count, sentence count, syllable count, and other scores including the Flesch score (the lower the score, the more difficult the text is to read) and the Dalechall score (it measures a text against a number of words considered familiar to fourth-graders, and the more unfamiliar words used, the higher the reading level will be). I found that Dumbledore's sentences are still the most complex (same as the movie), according to the Flesch score, and that shockingly Hagrid's sentences are the most complex according to the Dalechall score, which listed Hermione as the most complex in the movie. However, that could be because Hagrid says a lot of words in an accent, which J.K. Rowling emphasizes in how she spells words he says. A list of words a fourth-grader would know definitely wouldn't include \"yeh\" or \"gettin'\", it would include \"your\" and \"getting\" since that is the correct spelling."
